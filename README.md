krb5_support Cookbook
=============

Description
-----------

This cookbook alters the krb5.conf file from the original krb5 cookbook so it includes the ability to turn off KDC and use DNS for realm. It also adds the ability to set the default domain for krb4 backwareds compatibility.

Requirements
------------

This cookbook requires the krb5 cookbook.

Attributes
----------

In addition to the standard krb5 attributes the following attributes have been added:

 * `krb5['k4b5']['krb5_conf']['libdefaults']['default_realm']` - Sets the default domain
 * `krb5['krb5']['krb5_conf']['realms']['default_realm_kdc_dns']` - Sets default realm KDC DNS.
 * `krb5['krb5']['krb5_conf']['realms']['default_realm_kdc_default_domain']` - Sets default realm domain.

Usage
-----

Here are two example roles to be used with this recipe.  The first, is
a single realm configuration, using the OHAI domain attribute for the realm.

```
name "krb5_domain"
description "Configures Kerberos 5 Authentication for domain realm"
override_attributes "krb5" => {
   "krb5_conf" => {
    "realms" => {
      "default_realm_kdc_dns": "realm.net",
      "default_realm_kdc_default_domain": "domain.net"
    }
  }
}
run_list "recipe[krb5_support]"
```
